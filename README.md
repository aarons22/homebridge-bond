# homebridge-bond-searls

**This is a fork of [homebridge-bond](https://github.com/aarons22/homebridge-bond) that I made with some minor rate limit changes that were necessary to get it to work on my

## Installation

### Bond Parameters

| Option             | Required | Explanation |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ip_address`   | true   | To get your Bond IP Address, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/aarons22/homebridge-bond/wiki/Get-Bond-IP-Address). |
| `token` | true   | This can be found in the Bond app in your Bond Settings. Scroll down until you see `Local Token`. You can tap on the row to copy to your clipboard. |
| `hide_device_ids` | false  | Array of device ids to ignore (i.e. `["1111", "2222"]`) |

### Easiest Configuration

For the best experience setting up this plugin, please use [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x).

### HOOBS Configuration

In HOOBS, you need to provide the bonds (optionally, turn on opt-in features):
```json
[
    {
        "ip_address": "<IP_ADDRESS>",
        "token": "<TOKEN>",
        "hide_device_ids": ["123456"]
    }
]
```

<ins>Example Config in HOOBS:</ins>

![Config](./images/hoobs_configuration.png)

### Basic Configuration

Assuming a global installation of `homebridge`, install the plugin:

`npm i -g homebridge-bond`

Add the `Bond` platform in your homebridge `config.json` file:

```json
"platforms": [
    {
        "platform": "Bond",
        "bonds": [
            {
                "ip_address": "<IP_ADDRESS>",
                "token": "<TOKEN>"
            }
        ],
    }
],
```

NOTE: If you have a "Smart by BOND" fan/device, you will need to add a Bond in the config for _each_ fan/device.

### Optional Platform Parameters

| Option             | Default | Explanation                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `include_dimmer`   | false   | If dimming is a valid action on a device, it will be included as additional switch on the accessory. When using this feature, turn the switch on to start dimming. When you reach the brightness level you would like, turn the switch off. |
| `fan_speed_values` | false   | Use fan speed values instead of percentages (i.e. Hey Siri set the Office Fan to 2) |
| `include_toggle_state` | false  | This will add a switch to single-action accessories to toggle the state (i.e. Shades, Fireplace, Generic, Lights). Fan speeds are not eligible for this option. |

## Development

I'm more than happy to take PRs if you want to fix a bug you are having or take a shot at adding a new feature you're interested in. To compile the code in realtime, run:

```
npm run dev
```

To use the local version of the plugin in homebridge, I run `npm link` in the directory of the cloned repo.

## Support
